## What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python? :thinking: ##
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of
structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into
individual objects.
Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling
concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things,
like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on.
OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data
associated with them and can perform certain functions.
The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented
programming in Python, not only representing the data, as in procedural
programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.
